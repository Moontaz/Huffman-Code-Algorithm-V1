# Huffman Encoding for Image Compression

This comprehensive GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the Huffman Encoding algorithm for compressing and decompressing images. Huffman Encoding is a lossless data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, providing efficient compression for data with varying symbol frequencies.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the application of Huffman Encoding in image compression. The repository includes Python scripts and modules that demonstrate the compression and decompression processes, along with detailed implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm.

## Files in the Repository

1. **useHuffman.py**: This script serves as an example of using Huffman Encoding to compress an image. It utilizes the `HuffmanCoding` class from the `huffman_img.py` module.

2. **huffman_img.py**: The module contains the implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm for image compression. It includes a `HuffmanCoding` class with methods for compressing and decompressing images.

3. **decompress_huffman_image.py**: This script provides functionality to decompress a previously compressed image using the Huffman Coding algorithm.

4. **use_decompress.py**: This script demonstrates how to decompress a previously compressed image using the `decompress_huffman_image.py` module.
5. **dataset_image1.jpg**: Sample image for testing and experimentation.

## Usage

### Compression

To compress an image, run the `useHuffman.py` script:

```bash
python useHuffman.py
```

This script takes an input image (specified within the script) and generates a compressed binary file (`dataset_image1_compressed.bin`). The compressed file includes the Huffman tree structure, encoded pixel data, and metadata for decompression.

### Decompression

To decompress the compressed image, run the `use_decompress.py` script:

```bash
python use_decompress.py
```

This script reads the compressed binary file, reconstructs the Huffman tree, decodes the pixel data, and saves the decompressed image (`dataset_image1_decompressed.jpg`).

## Implementation Details

The Huffman Coding algorithm is implemented in the `HuffmanCoding` class within `huffman_img.py`. Key implementation details include:

- Construction of a Huffman tree based on pixel frequency.
- Generation of variable-length codes for each pixel.
- Compression of pixel data into a binary format.
- Decompression using the Huffman tree and encoded binary data.

## Sample Execution

Here is a brief overview of a sample execution:

1. **Compression:**
   - Run `useHuffman.py`.
   - Input: `dataset_image1.jpg`.
   - Output: `dataset_image1_compressed.bin`.

2. **Decompression:**
   - Run `use_decompress.py`.
   - Input: `dataset_image1_compressed.bin`.
   - Output: `dataset_image1_decompressed.jpg`.

## Continuous Integration

The repository is integrated with a continuous integration (CI) system, ensuring that changes made to the codebase are automatically tested. This helps maintain code quality and prevents regressions.

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Linting**: Ensures code adheres to style guidelines and best practices.

2. **Unit Tests**: Executes a suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of the Huffman Encoding implementation.

3. **Integration Tests**: Performs integration tests to verify the interoperability of different components.

4. **Code Coverage**: Measures the code coverage achieved by the tests, providing insights into the areas of the codebase that are thoroughly tested.
